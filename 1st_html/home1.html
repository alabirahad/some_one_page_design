                <p>Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan has been banned by the ICC for two years, with one year suspended, for failing to report multiple approaches made to him by bookies.

                        Under the provisions of the ICC Code, Shakib chose to admit the charges and agreed to the sanction with the ICC in lieu of an Anti-Corruption Tribunal hearing. Subject to him satisfying the conditions in respect of the suspended part of the sanction, he will be free to resume international cricket on 29 October 2020.</p>
